viaForensics :: JavaScript
==========================

I'm used to teaching children, so let me know if I'm moving too slowly.

Planning on talking about JS within the context of Node - not the browser

History of JavaScript
---------------------
- JavaScript, pre- and post-Crockford
- JavaScript, the Good Parts
- JavaScript, the Bad Parts: https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat
- JavaScript != The DOM API
- JavaScript the language is actually very small

The Basics
----------
- Types:


Control Structures:
 - if / if else / else
   - if else is "if else" and not "elif" (python), "elsif" (ruby) etc.
 - switch (not case)
 - for
 - while
 - do while

Intermediate
------------
- Chaining

The Interesting
---------------
- Closures
- Memoization
- Currying - show jlogger

callback functions
async nature of js


Use dev tools console as REPL

function scope
declaring functions within functions
constant- versus linear-time lookups

Etc
---
Coding standards


mdn is a good resource
samurai book is a good resource

double versus triple equals

jshint
git pre-commit hook

callback pyramid of doom
